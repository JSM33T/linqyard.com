# Behind the Scenes: Building a Modern Link Management Platform

## Introduction

Linqyard began with a simple observation — most people struggle to manage their online presence across platforms.
A portfolio here, a resume there, a handful of socials somewhere else.

Not everyone has time to build a website, but everyone deserves a clean, unified space to represent who they are.
That’s the idea behind **Linqyard** — and while we’ve released its foundation, we’re still actively shaping its systems, refining its architecture, and expanding the features that power it.

This post dives into **how we’re building Linqyard** — the stack, the decisions, and the evolving ideas behind its design.

## Frontend Architecture

The front-end is built with **Next.js**, where we’re adopting a **hybrid rendering** approach — combining **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** for public profile pages and **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)** for dynamic user dashboards.
This mix lets us balance performance, SEO, and interactivity as the app scales.

We’re continuously optimizing for:
- **Instant load times** on public bio pages.
- **Seamless navigation** for authenticated dashboards.
- **SEO consistency** across custom subdomains.

For **state management**, we use **Zustand**, keeping the app lightweight and predictable while avoiding unnecessary boilerplate.

**UI layer highlights:**
- **TailwindCSS** for a fast, responsive design system.
- **shadcn/ui** for elegant, accessible components.
- **Framer Motion** for subtle interactions and motion effects that make the experience feel alive.

The focus is on creating a **maintainable design system** — one that can grow as we introduce themes, editor tools, and user customization features.

## Backend Architecture

We’re building the backend on **.NET Core Web API**, structured for clarity and long-term scalability.

- **ORM:** **Entity Framework Core** — giving us strong typing and easy migrations.
- **Database:** **PostgreSQL**, our main data backbone.
- **Caching layers:**
  - **Redis** for high-speed lookups, link stats, and temporary sessions.
  - **MongoDB** for “warm” caching and semi-structured data (like analytics events or AI responses).
- **Logging:** **Serilog** for structured logs and observability.
- **Security:** Enforced HTTPS, hashed passwords, and layered middleware validation.

We’re also experimenting with **rate limiting**, **request tracking**, and **async caching strategies** to make every user request both secure and fast.

As Linqyard scales, the goal is to keep the backend **stateless, modular, and cloud-ready** — able to handle bursts of lightweight API calls without performance trade-offs.

## AI and Automation Layer

We’re currently building an **AI microservice** with **FastAPI**, designed to power smarter automation within Linqyard — things like link categorization, auto-generated summaries, and contextual recommendations.

- **LangChain** will provide structured reasoning and contextual embedding pipelines.
- The service communicates asynchronously with the main API via HTTP and event triggers.
- It’s isolated by design — ensuring that AI tasks never overload the core API.

This layer is in active development, forming the base for upcoming **smart link suggestions**, **content summaries**, and **AI-assisted user flows**.

## Infrastructure & Deployment

Linqyard’s infrastructure is containerized using **Docker** and orchestrated through **Docker Compose** (with an eye toward future **Kubernetes migration**).
Each service — Web API, FastAPI, Redis, PostgreSQL, and the front-end — runs in its own isolated container.

- **Storage:** Assets such as profile images and cover photos are hosted on **Azure Blob Storage** for reliability and CDN-level performance.
- **Scaling:** Stateless containers allow us to spin up additional instances easily during spikes.
- **Configuration:** Secrets and environment variables are securely injected during builds and deployments.

As we continue iterating, we’re refining our **CI/CD pipelines**, improving **build caching**, and setting up **monitoring and alerting** for better release visibility.

---

## Design Philosophy

Everything we build in Linqyard follows a few core principles:

- **Build modular, scale modular:** Each layer (UI, API, AI, Infra) can evolve independently.
- **Cache first, compute second:** Optimize before scaling up.
- **Security and observability by default:** Encryption, logging, and metrics are built in, not added later.
- **Iterate transparently:** Build in public, share learnings, and improve continuously.

We’re not just building a link manager — we’re engineering a **scalable digital identity platform** that feels modern, fast, and creator-friendly from day one.
