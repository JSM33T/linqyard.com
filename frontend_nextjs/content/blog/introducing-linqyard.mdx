## Introduction

The idea for Linqyard came up when I noticed a friend struggling to manage all his links — portfolio, socials, resume, and small projects — across different platforms.  
Not everyone has the time or resources to build and maintain a custom website, yet everyone needs a simple, organized way to present their online identity.  
That gap — between having “just a bunch of links” and owning a clean, personalized profile — led to the creation of Linqyard: a lightweight, customizable, and analytics-ready link management platform.

##  Frontend Architecture

The client is built with **Next.js**, leveraging **hybrid rendering** — a mix of **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** for SEO-sensitive pages and **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)** for user dashboards.  
This hybrid setup ensures:

- **Faster initial load** for public bio pages.  
- **Smoother navigation** and caching for logged-in dashboards.  
- **Improved SEO** for profile links shared across social platforms.

**State management** is handled by **Zustand**, chosen for its minimal boilerplate and predictable reactivity compared to heavier solutions like Redux.

**UI layer**:  
- **TailwindCSS** powers the core styling with utility classes for speed and consistency.  
- **shadcn/ui** provides accessible, reusable components with a polished, modern aesthetic.  

This combination allows the UI to stay consistent while maintaining developer agility.

##  Backend Architecture

The backend runs on **.NET Core Web API**, structured with clear separation between controllers, repositories, and services.  
- **ORM:** Entity Framework Core provides strong typing and safe database access while keeping migrations controlled.  
- **Database:** **PostgreSQL** serves as the primary relational database, ensuring ACID compliance and high reliability.  
- **Caching:**  
  - **Redis** handles high-speed ephemeral caching (e.g., link stats, session lookups).  
  - **MongoDB** is used for multi-tiered or warm-cache persistence where structured + semi-structured data co-exist.  
- **Logging:** **Serilog** tracks performance metrics, exceptions, and structured logs for detailed observability.  
- **Security:** Passwords are hashed and salted before storage, and all user operations are validated through secure middleware layers.

This design provides a **high-throughput**, **low-latency** backend suitable for thousands of lightweight requests per second.

##  AI and Automation Layer

Alongside the primary API runs an **AI microservice** built in **FastAPI**, specialized for chatbot and workflow automation features.  
- **LangChain** powers contextual understanding, summarization, and intelligent suggestions.  
- The API communicates asynchronously with the .NET Core backend using HTTP and message-based triggers.  
- This separation keeps AI computation isolated, avoiding load on the main application.

This layer lays the foundation for **smart link recommendations**, **content summaries**, and future **AI-driven automation**.

## Infrastructure & Deployment

Linqyard’s services are containerized using **Docker** and orchestrated with **Docker Compose**.  
Each service — Web API, FastAPI, Redis, PostgreSQL, and the front-end — runs in its own container for modular updates and clean rollbacks.

- **Storage:** Media assets (avatars, images, icons) are stored in **Azure Blob Storage**, benefiting from soft-delete, region redundancy, and predictable performance.  
- **Scaling:** Stateless service containers enable horizontal scaling with minimal overhead.  
- **Environment configuration:** Secrets, keys, and environment variables are injected securely through compose files and environment scopes.

This ensures **consistent builds**, **reproducible deployments**, and **minimal downtime** during updates.

##  Design Philosophy

Every component of Linqyard adheres to a few simple engineering principles:

- **Separation of responsibility:** Each layer (UI, API, AI, Infra) serves a specific role.  
- **Cache before compute:** Minimize redundant operations through layered caching.  
- **Observability by default:** Logging and metrics are integrated into every service.  
- **Secure by design:** No plaintext secrets, enforced HTTPS, and isolated access roles.

The result is a lightweight, developer-friendly system that scales cleanly as new features and analytics layers evolve.
