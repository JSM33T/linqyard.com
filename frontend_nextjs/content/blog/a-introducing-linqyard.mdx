## Introduction

The idea for Linqyard came up when I saw a friend juggling dozens of links — portfolio, social media, side projects, resumes — across multiple platforms.  
Not everyone has the time or tools to build a personal website, yet everyone needs a clean, organized space that represents who they are online.  

That’s where **Linqyard** comes in.  
A simple, customizable, and smart platform that gives you **one beautiful microsite** to share **all your important links** — from your work and socials to your shop, videos, or anything else you want the world to see.

## What Linqyard Is About

Think of Linqyard as your **personal homepage**, without the hassle of coding or hosting.  
You can:

- Create your own **profile link** (like `yourname.linqyard.com`) or even connect your **custom domain**.  
- Organize links by category — work, hobbies, social, or anything you want.  
- Add images, descriptions, and custom icons to make each link stand out.  
- Track **analytics** to see how many people viewed or clicked your links.  

It’s built for **creators, freelancers, students, and professionals** who want to look polished online — without managing a full website.

## Why Linqyard Matters

We live in a world where our online presence speaks louder than our resumes.  
From job applications to collaborations and small businesses, your first impression often starts with a link.

But most “link-in-bio” tools feel either too rigid or too cluttered. Linqyard focuses on balance — clean, modern, and genuinely yours.  
It’s not about just collecting links; it’s about **presenting your digital identity beautifully**.
